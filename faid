Hello, my name is Ivan and I live in Serbia, country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course Version Control with Git because I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in today programming in the version control area. I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge, I'm eager to work and to advance in my career. I had great experience with Coursera courses that I successfully completed previously and I really increased my programming knowledge so far on Coursera. Getting better in programming, which is my every day goal, requires constant learning and constant improving.

My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. Taking course Version Control with Git can help me advance in my knowledge. Git as a version control tool is something I came across few times now. I really want to know as much as I can about Git because it seams it is standard programming tool nowadays.

Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my programming knowledge in the past.
